FROM Sales
LEFT JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
LEFT JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
LEFT JOIN Owners ON Pets.OwnerID = Owners.OwnerID
GROUP BY Owners.City
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

```sql
SELECT Pets.Kind, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
LEFT JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
LEFT JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
GROUP BY Pets.Kind
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

```sql
SELECT Pets.Kind, Owners.City, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
LEFT JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
LEFT JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
LEFT JOIN Owners ON Pets.OwnerID = Owners.OwnerID
GROUP BY Owners.City, Pets.Kind
ORDER BY City;
```

```sql
SELECT Owners.City, ROUND(AVG(Procedures.Price),2) AS AverageSales
FROM Sales 
JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
JOIN Owners ON Pets.OwnerID = Owners.OwnerID
GROUP BY Owners.City
