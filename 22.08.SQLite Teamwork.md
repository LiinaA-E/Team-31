2.Calculate total Sales by Pet Kind
3.Calculate total Sales by City and Pet Kind

5.If you have additional time, explore relationships with SQLight

```sql
SELECT Owners.City, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
LEFT JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
LEFT JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
LEFT JOIN Owners ON Pets.OwnerID = Owners.OwnerID
GROUP BY Owners.City
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

```sql
SELECT Pets.Kind, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
LEFT JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
LEFT JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
GROUP BY Pets.Kind
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

```sql
SELECT Pets.Kind, Owners.City, SUM(Procedures.Price) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
LEFT JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
LEFT JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
LEFT JOIN Owners ON Pets.OwnerID = Owners.OwnerID
GROUP BY Owners.City, Pets.Kind
ORDER BY City;
```

```sql
SELECT Owners.City, ROUND(AVG(Procedures.Price),2) AS AverageSales
FROM Sales 
JOIN Procedures ON Sales.ProcedureCode = Procedures.ProcedureCode
JOIN Pets ON Sales.PetID = Pets.PetID
JOIN Owners ON Pets.OwnerID = Owners.OwnerID
GROUP BY Owners.City
ORDER BY AverageSales DESC;
```

RELATIONSHIPS
refer to the logical connections between tables in a database, typically enforced by foreign keys.
Relationships define how data in one table corresponds to data in another table.
1. One-to-One Relationship: A row in one table is related to one and only one row in another table
2. One-to-Many Relationship: A row in one table can be related to many rows in another table.
3. Many-to-Many Relationship: Rows in one table can be related to many rows in another table, and vice versa.
