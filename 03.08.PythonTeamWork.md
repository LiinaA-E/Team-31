To complete the tasks use 'pokemon.csv' dataset
Answer the following questions:
How many Pokémons are with 'Type 1' == Water as a % of total?
What is the maximum 'Speed' value? What is the minimum 'Speed' value? What is the difference between max and min 'Speed'?
Filter the DataFrame to include only the Pokémon with 'Speed' >= 80. How many Pokémon meet this criterion? Display this DataFrame using your preferred visualization method.
(DIFFICULT) Find Pokémon with the longest name (excluding spaces)? What is this pokemons name?

```py
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
pokemon_df = pd.read_csv('/content/Pokemon.csv')
#How many Pokémons are with 'Type 1' == Water as a % of total?
Water_pokemons = pokemon_df[pokemon_df['Type 1'] == 'Water']
Water_pokemons_percentage = ((len(Water_pokemons) * 100) / (len(pokemon_df)))
print(f'There are {Water_pokemons_percentage}% of Type 1 == Water Pokemons out of the total.')
#What is the maximum 'Speed' value? What is the minimum 'Speed' value?
min_speed = pokemon_df['Speed'].min()
max_speed = pokemon_df['Speed'].max()
print(f'Maximum Speed value is {max_speed} and minimum Speed value is {min_speed}.')
#What is the difference between max and min 'Speed'?
speed_difference = (max_speed - min_speed)
print(f'difference between max and min Speed is:', speed_difference)
#Filter the DataFrame to include only the Pokémon with 'Speed' >= 80.
fast_pokemons = pokemon_df[pokemon_df['Speed'] >= 80]
#How many Pokémon meet this criterion? Display this DataFrame using your preferred visualization method.
print(f'There are {len(fast_pokemons)} Pokemons whos speed is >= 80')
plt.hist(fast_pokemons['Speed'], color = 'grey', edgecolor = 'black', alpha=0.7)
```
